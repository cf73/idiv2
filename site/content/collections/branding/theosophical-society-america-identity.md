      <p>When we get dressed in the morning, we usually think
      about what we will be doing that day, who we will be meeting, and what overall
      image we would like to portray.&nbsp; A new
      look usually gives us a lift and puts a little more bounce in our step.&nbsp; At Olcott, your national center, the staff
      has been looking for ways to give the Society a little more bounce in the way
      that it meets the public.&nbsp; We have
      considered what image would best represent us to new seekers who might be
      attracted and want to become a part of us.</p><p>Our explorations took us to the “designer
      shop.”&nbsp; We didn’t want just any look; we
      wanted to have that special flair that bespeaks care and forethought to the
      overall appearance.&nbsp; We were fortunate
      enough to have former national board member Tom Ockerse, also former head of
      the School of Design at Rhode Island School of Design, to offer us help in
      developing our visual image.&nbsp; Tom, being
      a long-time member was familiar with the mission of the Society, but he was
      challenged with how one might get the idea across symbolically.&nbsp; He explored different ways of writing the
      name, “the Theosophical Society in America”, a mouthful which alone is enough
      to scare off some timid souls.&nbsp; As he
      worked with it, he discovered that parts of the name could be juxtaposed so
      that the O’s in Theosophy and Society could be placed over each other in such a
      way as to form a triangle.&nbsp;
      Interestingly, when written in all caps, this arrangement actually makes
      the name easier to read.&nbsp;</p><p>The triplicity of O’s brought about the idea to
      place their smaller reflection above them, seen as three dots.&nbsp; Now there were two triangles, slight but
      present, with many implied meanings—as above so below, 3 objects, 3 fundamental
      propositions, etc.&nbsp; And a bonus appeared
      in that this pattern of three dots was used by Master KH as a postscript
      incorporated into his signature, thus subtly evoking the energy of the early
      founders.</p><p>The official seal is still maintained on the new
      stationary design, but more as an official coat of arms than the primary
      focus.&nbsp; It gives a feeling of being well
      established and also provides the clear link with our history and International
      Headquarters at Adyar.</p><p>To give an updated look, the body of a letter on the
      new stationary will have slightly more than a two-inch left-hand margin so that
      the edge of text falls directly in line with “in America.”&nbsp; The right-hand margin will be ragged and only
      about a half inch wide in order to have adequate spacing for the body of the
      letter. This gives a fresh and modern look to our correspondence.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope you like our more current fashion.&nbsp; It is only the beginning of exploring
      iterations of our new look as it will soon be translated into mailings,
      advertisements, website, and more.&nbsp; Tom
      will evaluate each aspect of our visual image as it comes up for review, in
      order to apply this new visual language as it unfolds in our many applications.&nbsp; Soon we will have a whole new wardrobe with a
      unified look that we hope will attract positive attention from interested
      seekers. &nbsp;</p>
