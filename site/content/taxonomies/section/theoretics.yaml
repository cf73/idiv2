  <p>Theory helps to develop a framework for principles as a
  foundation on which to build. We learn about “visual phenomena” and “contrast”
  to understand principles that apply to many types of specific situations.
  Theory demonstrates interrelations and maps the organization of specifics. Theory de-mystifies the complex; and
  this is essential to education, because to
  understand means to simplify.&nbsp;</p>
